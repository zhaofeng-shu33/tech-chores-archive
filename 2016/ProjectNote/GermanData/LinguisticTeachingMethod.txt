Design features for a self-contained teaching program:
Information: must introduce syntactic and morphological rules explicitly
syntactic forms
Goal: must be supplied in order to motivate performance and reflection on performance
Integration: the information and performance exercises must be seqenced in a way that introduces new linguistic items only in the context of known items
Performance: is required to allow matching against the target from the take place; it must be elicited in a sequence that allows progressive decontextualisation to occur;
Feedback: must deal explicitly with any diagnosed misconception or mal-rules; must provide help with
analysing the gap between learner performance and target form
