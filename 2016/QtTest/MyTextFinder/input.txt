I am writing a thesis entitled ¡®Student Attitude Towards GaoKao English¡¯. It is my homework for my English lesson. I want to conduct an informal survey among you. Can you give me a feedback?
Q1: (you can recall what you thought at that time) What did you anticipate in GaoKao English before entering high school?
Q2: As time went on in your receiving high school English education, your attitude towards GaoKao English changed. Can you describe them and how they happened?
