A splendid midsummer shone over England:
skies so pure, suns so radiant as were then seen
in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our
wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days
had come from the South, like a flock of glorious
passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs
of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were
in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted,
contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
On Midsummer-eve, Ad¨¨le, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane
half the day,
had gone to bed with the sun.
I watched her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
