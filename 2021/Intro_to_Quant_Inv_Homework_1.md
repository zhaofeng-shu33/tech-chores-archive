Introduction to Quantitative Investment

Homework 1

-   We assume the arbitrager has n1 dollars and the noise trader has n2
    dollars, p = probability (the arbitrager wins on each bet) = 55% and
    q= probability (the noisy trader wins on each bet) = 1-p = 45%.
    Based on gambler's ruining theory, P = probability (the arbitrager
    wins finally) = \[1- power (q/p, n1)\] / \[1- power(q/p, n1+n2)\].

1)  If n2 = 10, which number should n1 be larger than or equal to in
    order to make sure that P is larger than or equal to 50%? (n1 is an
    integer) n1 \>= 4

2)  If n1 = 1 and n2 =10, which percentage should p be larger than or
    equal to in order to make sure that P is larger than or equal to
    50%? p\>=67%

3)  Please comment on the phenomena on question 1) and 2) and explain
    what they mean for limits of arbitrage.

-   Anna and Barbara work on same kind of jobs in two different
    countries. They have same starting salary, \$30,000, in first year.
    In second year, the country Anna works in has no inflation and she
    get 2% salary raise. However, the country Barbara works in has 4%
    inflation and she get 5% salary raise. Who gets better compensation?
    Who will be happier? If the two answers are inconsistent, what is
    their cognitive bias? ( Hint: it is called Money illusion )

> Anna get better compensation but Barbara will be happier.

> The cognitive bias comes from the illusion that people tend to view
> their wealth in nominal dollar terms and ignore the inflation effect.

-   Please read paper 2.3, **The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology
    of Choice, written by** Amos Tversky; Daniel Kahneman and descript
    how the prospects theory explain **The Framing of Acts, The Framing
    of Contingencies and The Framing of Outcomes. **

> The Framing of Acts are explained mainly by the shape of the value
> function, which is S-shaped.
>
> The Framing of Contingencies are explained by the pseudo-certainty
> effect, in which decisions are made conditioning on some non-occurring
> state.
>
> The Framing of Outcomes are explained by the changing of the reference
> point.

-   Please find a paper or a financial engineering research report from
    a broker which is related to behavioral finance. Sum up the strategy
    and its behavioral finance support.
